Each file in here defines variables relevant to specific groups of servers.  The actual groups are defined, and servers assigned to groups, in the `hosts` file in the deployment root folder.

The file `all.yaml` is a special one that contains variables that are valid for all host groups, and is also where the local server variables are stored.
