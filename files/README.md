Files, broken up in to three types:

- configuration files, like apache `.conf` files
- credential files
- shell scripts (e.g. backup to S3 scripts)

Typically in ansible files are kept within folders with the roles, but I have moved them here as for smaller projects it's easier to isolate & find things this way.
